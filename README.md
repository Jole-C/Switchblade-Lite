# Project repo for Switchblade Lite.

A small top down arcade project, revived from an unfinished GameMaker Studio 2 project. This readme will be updated when there's more to say.

## Any questions, just ask!
This code is licensed all rights reserved, but if you want to do anything with it, just ask me. I'll probably say it's fine.

## Switchblade was made possible thanks to the following libraries:
- LÖVE2D - The framework used to create this project! https://love2d.org/
- bump - An awesome AABB collision library for LÖVE https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua
- batteries - A super useful library with lots of helpful additions https://github.com/1bardesign/batteries/tree/master
- baton - A very useful and flexible library for gamepad and keyboard support https://github.com/tesselode/baton
