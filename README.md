# Project repo for Switchblade Lite.

A small top down arcade project, revived from an unfinished GameMaker Studio 2 project. This readme will be updated when there's more to say.

## Any questions, just ask!
If you want to do anything with this source that's totally fine, but I would prefer to be asked first.

## Switchblade was made possible thanks to the following libraries:
- LÖVE2D - The framework used to create this project! https://love2d.org/
- bump - An awesome AABB collision library for LÖVE https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua
- hump - A barebones library for LÖVE including Gamestates, class, vector support, and more https://github.com/HDictus/hump
- baton - A very useful and flexible library for gamepad and keyboard support https://github.com/tesselode/baton
