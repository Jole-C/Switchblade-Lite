# Project repo for Switchblade Lite. This project is MIT open source!

A small top down arcade project, revived from an unfinished GameMaker Studio 2 project. This readme will be updated when there's more to say.

## Any questions, just ask!
If you want to do anything with this source that's totally fine, but I would prefer to be asked first.
